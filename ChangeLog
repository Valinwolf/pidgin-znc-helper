Version 1.5.1 (2014/03/17):
	* Changed the compatibility fix from last version to not be based on the
	  libpurple version string as this breaks when the changes are being
	  backported (and they are as they are security fixes).

Version 1.5.0 (2014/01/29):
	* Fixed compatibility issue with Pidgin 2.10.8
	* Updated message parser to match modified key messages (this should be an
	option instead of being hard-coded, sorry)
	* Added French and Sinhalese translation (Thanks to londumas and Thambaru
	Wijesekara)

Version 1.4 (2012/02/29):
	* Process self-posted incoming messages too. (This happens e.g. when using ZNC behind an irssi-proxy.) Really! ;)
	  Please make sure to read https://bugs.launchpad.net/pidgin-znc-helper/+bug/900754 carefully!
	
Version 1.3.1 (2011/11/25):
	* Process self-posted incoming messages too. (This happens e.g. when using ZNC behind an irssi-proxy.)
	* Added Spain and Russian translation

Version 1.3 (2010/08/05):
	* don't check whether the timestamp is in the end of the string (mIRC sends special formatting characters that are interpreted into HTML from Pidgin which means that the timestamps aren't anymore at the end)
	* check whether the part of the message after timestamp contains only HTML tags (this means usually the timestamp was at the end of the message)
	* time offset per account including new preferences dialog

Version 1.2 (2010/06/05):
	* added advice to preferences window
	* Fix: empty messages when timestamp is not appended (#570265)

Version 1.1 (2010/03/18):
	* display italic buddy names if buddy is offline

Version 1.01 (2009/11/16):
	* corrected plugins website

Version 1.0 (2009/11/16):
	* added support for personal messages
	* updated UI requirements

Version 0.4 (2009/11/12):
	* fixed Readme for Windows (again -.-')
	* added an option to offset wrong times (for some friends :) I know it isn't really the plugins job)
	* the plugin now blocks unloading to avoid orphan options in account settings
	* new timestamp handler to avoid displaying the date on every message

Version 0.3 (2009/11/10):
	* fixed issue with daylight saving time
	* fixed Readme files

Version 0.2 (2009/10/05):
	* implemented own timestamp recognition to safely notice recognition failures
	* changed ZNC timestamp format to "[%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S]" appended to the end of the message which fixes a bug when replaying /me-messages

Version 0.1 (2009/10/02):
	* ZNC Helper was born.
