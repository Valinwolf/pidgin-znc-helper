Version 1.3.2 (????/??/??):
	* Process self-posted incoming messages too. (This happens e.g. when using ZNC behind an irssi-proxy.) Really! ;)

Version 1.3.1 (2011/11/25):
	* Process self-posted incoming messages too. (This happens e.g. when using ZNC behind an irssi-proxy.)
	* Added Spain and Russian translation

Version 1.3 (2010/08/05):
	* don't check wether the timestamp is in the end of the string (mIRC sends special formatting characters that are interpreted into HTML from Pidgin which means that the timestamps aren't anymore at the end)
	* check wether the part of the message after timestamp contains only HTML tags (this means usually the timestamp was at the end of the message)
	* time offset per account including new preferences dialog

Version 1.2 (2010/06/05):
	* added advice to preferences window
	* Fix: empty messages when timestamp is not appended (#570265)

	* added an option to offset wrong times (for some friends :) I know it isn't really the plugins job)
	* the plugin now blocks unloading to avoid orphan options in account settings
	* new timestamp handler to avoid displaying the date on every message

Version 0.3 (2009/11/10):
	* fixed issue with daylight saving time
	* fixed Readme files

Version 0.2 (2009/10/05):

	* changed ZNC timestamp format to "[%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S]" appended to the end of the message which fixes a bug when replaying /me-messages
